What I learned: this is complicated.  Is temperature treated as ex ante, as in you have to forecast it yourself?  You must have some forecast, how
is that given to the system?  
I think a way that makes sense is to have missing for the target variable denote the forecast range, missing in the temperature variable denotes
either smooth or forecast this
